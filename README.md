### Surface

The dark grey color was used to design the page.

### Technology

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.2.1)
4. Javascript


### Features
This website was designed for two page only. You can find pages that gallery, map view and contact. The site was build for mobile friendly using Bootstrap features. Some new holiday places and its information will be added in the future.


### Testing
When you look at this website can find some information about the classes and its timetables and also links to our social media pages.

If you want to send a message to us, you need to fill the form on Contact section. If you do not fill the form, you will be notified because the "required" attribute was added to each fields of the form.

All social media links open in a new window using '"target="_blank"' and all of them have been tested to make sure that they open in a new tab and correct destination.

This website was tested on different browsers and mobile devices to make sure everything is working correctly. On mobile devices, the page was looking responsive and all sections was shown in the middle.

HMTL and CSS codes were tested on W3C Validation Service and both tests were passed.
