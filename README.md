My aim for the website design was in the easiest way possible to search holiday destinations while trying to make a website for user-friendly page.

### Scope
For holiday makers, I wanted to provide them some information about holiday places like hotel and restaurants on the map and show some images.

### Structure
In the search section, I try to show that which destinations can be found on the map and there is also short info of each places they can choose. A

### Surface

The dark grey color was used to design the page.

### Technology

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.2.1)
4. Javascript


### Features
This website was designed for two page only. You can find pages that gallery, map view and contact. The site was build for mobile friendly using Bootstrap features. Some new holiday places and its information will be added in the future.


### Testing
All internal and external navigation links have been tested on the site. The interactive map, form validation, the submit, and reset buttons have also been tested. The responsive design has also been tested using the Chrome Developer Tools. All HTML, CSS, and JS files have been passed through code validators and errors have been fixed. On mobile devices, the page was looking responsive and all sections was shown in the middle.

If you want to send a message to us, you need to fill the form on Contact section. If you do not fill the form, you will be notified because the "required" attribute was added to each fields of the form.

All social media links open in a new window using '"target="_blank"' and all of them have been tested to make sure that they open in a new tab and correct destination.

#### Manual Testing

This website was tested on different browsers and mobile devices to make sure everything is working correctly. I used google chrome developer mode to test the website on different devices I also tested the website on my phone (samsung galaxy s21 Ultra).

Also it was tested on devices below;

| Browser       | OS             | Device        | Result        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Safari        | iOS 10.3       | iPhone 6      | OK            |
| Opera         | Android 11.0   | Galaxy Tab A6 | OK            |
| Opera         | Windows 10     | Desktop       | OK            |
| Firefox       | Windows 10     | Desktop       | OK            |
| Chrome        | Windows 10     | Desktop       | OK            |
| Chrome        | Android 12     | Sansung S22   | OK            |

While manual testing I made sure that the:

- The site was visible correctly on all devices
- Buttons were operational
- Text input box's allowed all users to input correctly
- Web links opened up new windows

As a traveller I want:

- To learn about hotels and place of interests in holiday places in Turkey
- The interactive map feature gives an overview of the location of hotels and restaurants in Izmir, Mugla and Antalya in Turkey using the scroll and zoom function.
- To know which destination would be suitable and that matches my budget
- To see the map labels to get address and price information.

I also used online tool chrome extension Lighthouse to check the performance.

The result is here: [Lighthouse Test Result](https://ayhanuzumcu.github.io/milestone-project-2/w3c-validation/light.jpg)

HMTL and CSS codes were tested on W3C Validation Service and both tests were passed.

You can find the links to the test results here:

During the self-testing, I have added a class to the top nav bar using "fixed-top" Bootstrap class to fixed the navbar on the top of the page. And also the menu items set to the right on mobile friendly pages.
